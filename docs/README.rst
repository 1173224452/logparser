Welcome to logparser's documentation!
=====================================

Logparser provides a toolkit and benchmarks for automated log parsing, which is a crucial step towards structured log analytics. Logparser implements a number of state-of-the-art data-driven approaches for this goal. By applying logparser, users can automatically learn event templates from unstructured logs and convert raw log messages into a sequence of structured events.
